Instructions for building the diagrams user manual
==================================================

Things you will need
--------------------

* python docutils package

  If you are on an OS with some sort of package manager, docutils is
  almost certainly available as a package.  Otherwise, you can get it from:

    http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

* Haskell docutils package

  A collection of some utilities for transforming docutils documents.
  Currently unreleased, so get it by doing

    darcs get http://code.haskell.org/~byorgey/code/docutils
    cd docutils
    cabal install

* cairo development libraries

  Your package manager probably has it, or get it from

    http://cairographics.org/

* Haskell gtk2hs build tools

    cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools

* The latest diagrams sources

    darcs get http://patch-tag.com/r/byorgey/diagrams-core
    cd diagrams-core && cabal install && cd ..
    darcs get http://patch-tag.com/r/byorgey/diagrams-lib
    cd diagrams-lib && cabal install && cd ..
    darcs get http://patch-tag.com/r/byorgey/diagrams-cairo
    cd diagrams-cairo && cabal install && cd ..

* Other needed Hackage packages:

    cabal install hxt cryptohash base16-bytestring hint
  
Building and editing
--------------------

At this point, building should be as simple as typing 

  make

The generated HTML output will be in diagrams-manual.html.  Edits
should be made to diagrams-manual.rst.  For a quick reference on
reStructuredText syntax, see

  http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

To do a clean build (to ensure that xml2html is recompiled, etc.),
type 

  make clean

However, 'make clean' does not get rid of the cached images stored in
images/.  (Each image is stored in a file whose name is a hash of the
diagram source.) To delete them type

  make imgclean

or just rm images/*.  For example you might need to do this if you
make a change to the diagrams library itself which will change the
output of one or more of the example diagrams.  Also, if you make lots
of tweaks to example diagrams while developing them, the cache
directory will get filled up with lots of image files that are no
longer needed, so you may wish to periodically clear out the cache.
