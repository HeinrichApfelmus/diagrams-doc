Diagrams is a powerful, flexible, declarative domain-specific language
for creating vector graphics.  Diagrams is:

* *Declarative*: you specify *what* a diagram is, not *how* to draw it.

* *Compositional*: diagrams can be easily combined in many ways to produce
   more complex diagrams.  

* *Embedded*: the full power of Haskell, including every library on
   [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org), is available to help construct and manipulate diagrams.

* *Extensible*: extending diagrams with additional or higher-level
   functionality is as simple as writing a Haskell module.

* *Flexible*: diagrams is designed from the ground up to be as generic
   and flexible as possible.
