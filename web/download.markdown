If you already have the [Haskell
Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) as well as [cairo](http://www.cairographics.org/), getting diagrams should be as simple as

    cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools diagrams

(You only need to include `gtk2hs-buildtools` if you have never
installed `gtk2hs` or any of its components before -- if you are
unsure, it can't hurt to include it.)

Otherwise, see the [tutorial](/tutorial/DiagramsTutorial.html) for more detailed
instructions.
