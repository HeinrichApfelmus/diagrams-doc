If you already have the [Haskell
Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) as well as [cairo](http://www.cairographics.org/), getting diagrams should be as simple as

    cabal install diagrams-cairo

Otherwise, see the [quick start
tutorial](/tutorial/DiagramsTutorial.html) for more detailed
instructions.
