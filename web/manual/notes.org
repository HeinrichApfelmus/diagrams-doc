Features I need to figure out how to support:

  - include type signatures of functions automatically?
    How to indicate a placeholder for such inserted type signatures?
  - cross-links to other sections
  - links to Diagrams API documentation -- just put in placeholders
  - special markup for function names that should be links to the
    haddocks (in addition to being set in a monospaced font)
